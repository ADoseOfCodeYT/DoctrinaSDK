# Doctrina SDK
 
Doctrina SDK is a small hobby SDK with a 3D C++ game engine and an editor that uses the game engine.
There are no plans to make fully-fledged games with this sdk.

How did I come up with the name Doctrina? 
Well, Doctrina is Latin for learning and the point of this SDK is to learn how to make game engine.
